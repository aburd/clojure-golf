Welcome to Tokyo Clojure Golf!

You can get started by running:
```
clj -M:help
```

Or you can just start doing the challenges. I recommend completing the challenges in this order:

- golf.2025.2.loading
- golf.2025.2.search-light
- golf.2025.2.forest-for-the-keys

If you finish everything, consider helping somebody else or trying more challenges on https://codegolf.stackexchange.com.
